# Walmart-Sales-Foreecast

The overview of the project is to identify the forecasting future sales across various departments within different Walmart outlets. The challenging aspect of this data science  project  is  to  forecast  the  sales  on  4  major  holidays – Labour  Day,  Christmas, Thanksgiving and Super Bowl. 
The selected holiday markdown events are the ones when Walmart  makes  highest  sales  and  by  forecasting  sales  for  these  events,  they  want  to ensure that there is sufficient product supply to meet the demand. 
The dataset contains various details like markdown discounts, consumer price index, whether the week was a holiday, temperature, store size, store type and unemployment rate.
